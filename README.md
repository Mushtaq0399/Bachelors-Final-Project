## Project Abstract
Cryptography is the method of gaining protection by encoding the
original information, ensuring that only the intended recipients can interpret and
process it. Any cryptographic algorithm has two important functions,
encryption and decryption, which are complementary processes used for data
integrity. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a cryptographic algorithm
that is one of the most important among other algorithms because it has keys of
different sizes and a 128-bit input. A partial reconfiguration is applied to the
AES algorithm to boost its ability to encrypt and decrypt vast amount of data
with multiple permutations. This paper presents selective SubBytes row
swapping through run time reconfiguration that uses partial reconfiguration in
run time to swap rows in the first round depending on the mode selected.
Modelsim is used to simulate the design, while Xilinx Vivado software is used
to synthesize and implementation is carried on the Zynq FPGA (Field
Programmable Gate Array) architecture. The results were verified using the Zed
Board.
